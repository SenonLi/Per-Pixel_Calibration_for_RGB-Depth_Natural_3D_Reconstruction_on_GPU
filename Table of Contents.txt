Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 3D Reconstruction

Optical -> from row and column to Xw/Yw (Camera Calibration)
core: Ways to determine Depth as Zw

1.2 Traditional RGB-D camera Rectification (specially with cheap low quality lenses)

a.Find the translation from Zw to Xw/Yw (pinhole camera model + radial distortion)
b.Depth Rectification

1.3 Contributions of this thesis (abandon pinhole camera model)
	****  Real-Time Analysis  ******
	****  high order **********
	****  accurate calibration system *******
1.4 Summation

Real-time XYZ recified Reconstruction

Chapter 2: Wold XYZ Rectification ( on PrimeSense, KinectV2, and Prosilica )all of equations
2.1 From Depth to Z-coordinate
2.2 From Z to X/Y
2.3 3D Reconstructions for PrimeSense, KinectV2, and Prosilica
2.4 Mathematical tools
2.4.1 singular value decomposition
2.4.2 least square solution with pseudo-inverse method


X= ExZ + Fx
Y= EyZ + Fy
with what we are doing)


Chpater 3: System for RGBD Camera Calibration(experiment, collecting data)
2.1 Rail System
2.2 Round Grid for Radial X/Y Distortion Correction
2.3 Optical-Flow Sensor for Z Tracking
2.4 Bluetooth Low Energy for wireless communication

Chapter 4: results for 3 types of RGB-D cameras.
Chapter 5: conclusion


Talor polinomial for continous function data.
